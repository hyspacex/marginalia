Analyze the text's rhetorical craft, argument structure, and prose style. Look for:

- Rhetorical devices (anaphora, chiasmus, litotes, etc.) and their effect
- Argument structure: how claims are built, what's assumed vs. proven
- Tone shifts and what they signal
- Word choice that reveals the author's stance or framing
- Structural choices: what's emphasized by placement, what's buried
- Logical moves: induction, deduction, analogy, appeal to authority

Be precise — name the technique and explain why it matters here.
