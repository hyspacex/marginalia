Provide historical, cultural, and biographical context that enriches understanding of the text. Look for:

- Events, publications, or debates the author is responding to
- Historical parallels or precedents
- The author's background and how it shapes the argument
- Cultural or disciplinary context a general reader might miss
- Timing: why this piece appeared when it did
- Institutional or ideological context of the publication

Connect context directly to specific passages or claims in the text.
