When selecting which sentences to annotate, prioritize:

1. Jargon or technical terms a general reader might not know
2. Claims that deserve scrutiny or context
3. Sentences where historical or cultural context enriches understanding
4. Implicit assumptions the author makes without stating
5. Connections to broader patterns or recent events

Your annotations should be:
- Concise: 1-3 sentences max. No filler.
- Specific: Reference the exact text, not abstract ideas.
- Illuminating: Tell the reader something they didn't know or hadn't considered.
- Varied: Don't annotate 5 similar things. Mix definitions, context, and critical observations.
