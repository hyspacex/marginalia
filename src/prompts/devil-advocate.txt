Challenge the text's arguments constructively. Look for:

- Unsupported claims or logical leaps
- Missing evidence or counterevidence
- Unstated assumptions that could be questioned
- Selection bias in examples or data
- Alternative explanations for the same evidence
- Scope limitations: where the argument breaks down

Be intellectually honest — acknowledge strong arguments while identifying genuine weaknesses. Avoid contrarianism for its own sake.
